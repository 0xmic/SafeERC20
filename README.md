# SafeERC20  

## Introduction  

In the Ethereum ecosystem, as token standards evolved and became more complex, developers encountered numerous edge cases and inconsistencies when integrating different tokens. SafeERC20 is a library designed to help address these issues, specifically those related to the ERC20 standard.

- [OpenZeppelin Code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol)  

**SafeERC20 Functions**:  
- safeTransfer(token, to, value)  
- safeTransferFrom(token, from, to, value)  
- safeApprove(token, spender, value)  
- safeIncreaseAllowance(token, spender, value)  
- safeDecreaseAllowance(token, spender, value)  

## Why SafeERC20 Exists  

1. **Inconsistent ERC20 Implementations**: Not all ERC20 tokens strictly followed the standard. Some would revert on failure while others returned false. This inconsistency made it challenging to write general-purpose code that could interact with any ERC20 token.  

2. **Lack of Return Values in Early ERC20**: The original ERC20 standard didn't mandate `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions to return a boolean value indicating success or failure. Some tokens implemented these functions without return values, leading to potential silent failures.  

3. **Over-approval Issue**: Calling `approve` with a non-zero value for the same spender more than once can expose users to an attack where the approved allowance can be manipulated by the spender in between the two `approve` calls.  

## Features of SafeERC20  

1. **Standardized Interface**: SafeERC20 offers a consistent interface to interact with any ERC20 token, irrespective of its specific quirks.  

2. **Checks Return Value**: SafeERC20 checks the return value of `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve`. If a token doesn't return a value, it doesn't revert but handles it gracefully. For tokens that return a value, it ensures that the value is true.  

3. **Safe Approve**: To address the over-approval issue, the library first sets the allowance to 0 before setting it to a new value. This ensures that there's no risk of the double-spend problem in the gap between two approval operations.  

## When to Use SafeERC20  

1. **Broad Compatibility**: If you're writing a contract that needs to interact with multiple ERC20 tokens, especially those not well-known or audited, using SafeERC20 can help ensure that your contract behaves correctly regardless of any peculiarities in the token's implementation.  

2. **Avoiding Edge Cases**: When you want to avoid unexpected behavior or errors due to the inconsistent implementations of ERC20 tokens.  

3. **Security**: If you want to ensure the best practices when calling approve and prevent potential attacks related to token allowances.  

## Conclusion  

SafeERC20 emerged as a solution to real-world problems developers faced with inconsistent ERC20 token implementations. Using SafeERC20 is highly recommended when building applications or smart contracts that interact with a variety of ERC20 tokens to ensure consistent behavior, security, and to handle potential edge cases gracefully.
